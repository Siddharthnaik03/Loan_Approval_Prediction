# ***Loan Approval Prediction***
Banks must consider various factors when determining the eligibility of an applicant for a loan. Machine learning is frequently used in the financial sector to forecast loan approval. In order to develop a machine learning model for predicting loan approval, I have adhered to the following steps :  

### **Data Collection and Pre-processing**:
Collect historical loan data, including both approved and denied loans.
Clean and pre-process the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing numerical features.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
Analyze the number of rows and columns, data types, and the presence of missing values.
Examine the distribution of the target variable, which typically indicates whether a loan was approved or denied. Visualize the distribution using a bar plot.
Explore the distribution of individual features, both numerical and categorical, using bar charts. Identify outliers using box plots.

### **Data Splitting**:
Split the data into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

### **Model Selection**:
Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm. In this case, I have utilized common algorithms such as Random Forests for this binary classification problem.

### **Model Training**:
Train the chosen model using the training data.

### **Model Evaluation**:
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy.

### **Results**: The project achieves an accuracy of approximately 0.78 using a Random Forest model.
